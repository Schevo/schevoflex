=================================
 Getting Started with SchevoFlex
=================================


Supported platforms
===================

As of this writing, the following platforms have been confirmed to
work as development platforms for SchevoFlex:

- Mac OS X 10.5


Download prerequisites
======================

1. Install Mercurial.  See `Using Mercurial to contribute to Schevo
   </hg.txt>`__ for a brief primer.

2. In a work directory of your choice, clone the `schevoflex-open`
   repository to get "bleeding edge" code.  Clone the `schevoflex-dev`
   repository to get more stable, reviewed code.  In this example,
   we'll go for the former:

     .. sourcecode:: text

         mkdir work
         cd work
         hg clone http://getschevo.org/hg/schevoflex-open

3. Into the work directory, download the Flex 3 SDK from the `Adobe
   Flex 3 SDK Downloads page
   <http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk/Download+Flex+3>`__.
   Choose the "Adobe Flex SDK" as you'll be using not only the
   MPL-licensed code, but also some of the tools included that are not
   licensed under the MPL.

   Extract the downloaded file (``flex_sdk_3.0.0.477.zip`` is the
   latest version as of this writing) into a directory within the work
   directory. In this example, we use ``flex3sdk`` as the directory
   name:

     .. sourcecode:: text

         mkdir flex3sdk
         cd flex3sdk
         unzip ../flex_sdk_3.0.0.477.zip
         cd ..

4. Into the work directory, download the FlexUnit library from the
   `FlexUnit Google Code page
   <http://code.google.com/p/as3flexunitlib/>`__.  Choose the ZIP file
   available under "Featured Downloads".

   Extract the downloaded file (``flexunit-.85.zip`` is the latest
   version as of this writing) into the work directory.  It
   automatically places all files within a directory named
   ``flexunit``:

     .. sourcecode:: text

         unzip flexunit-.85.zip


Set up development mode
=======================

Within your local clone of the SchevoFlex repository, set up the
project in development mode:

  .. sourcecode:: text

      python setup.py develop


Run full suite of tests
=======================

Run the full suite of tests, which involves running both Python-based
and Flash-based tests:

  .. sourcecode:: text

      python testall.py

.. note::
